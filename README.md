1. Clone this repository into your `quizzes` directory.
1. Create an `index.html` and a `js102.js` file and link them together.
1. Write a JavaScript function that accepts an array of integers as an argument, and returns a new array that is sorted in ascending order (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4). Remember that the JavaScript sort function doesn't work as expected on integers. You have to write a lambda expression for the sort method. A quick Google search should help if it's not in your notes.
1. Write a JavaScript function that accepts an array of integers, and returns a new array that contains elements from the original array that are larger than 25.
1. In your HTML, create one input field of type `text` and one <button> element.
1. Attach an event handler to the button click with jQuery.
1. When the button is clicked retrieve the value of the input box. You should enter in a comma-delimited list of integers (e.g. 10,3,5,67,22).
1. Convert that string of comma-delimited numbers into an array.
1. Pass that array into the function that finds numbers higher than 25. Remember how to convert strings to numbers?
1. Take the result of filtering out numbers higher than 25, and pass it into the function that sorts the array and store the results.
1. Loop over the results of the sorted array and create a DOM string that wraps a <div> element around each number (e.g. output += something).
1. Give each <div> a class of "number".
1. Write a CSS class that changes the font color of the even elements to red.
1. Write a CSS class that changes the background color of the odd elements to azure.
1. Push all of your code to Github.
1. Send the link to your Github project to your assigned TA.
